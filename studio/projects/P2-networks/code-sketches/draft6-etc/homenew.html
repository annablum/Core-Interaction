	<h1>On Punctuation Gertrude Stein</h1>

	<div class="text punctuation-text-first">
		<p>When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active
			present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me.
			I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and
			conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.
		So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so
			and later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.</p>
