    <div class="fisrt"><p>When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active
        present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. 
        I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and 
        conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.</p></div>
    
        <div class="second"><p>So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so 
            and later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.</p></div>
