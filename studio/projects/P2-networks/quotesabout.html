                <p>Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also <strong>" "</strong>, they are unnecessary, 
                    they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not 
                    know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a quotation. 
                    When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use the question mark and <strong>" "</strong>
                    and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but 
                    not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.
